		<h4 id="q-1">1. Why do you want to be a designer?</h4>

		<p>To share creativity with others and help with the movement of graphic design but I also like money.</p>


		<h4 id="q-2">2. What makes you nervous about becoming a designer?</h4>

		<p>Being told that what I do isn’t good enough and facing struggling challenges.</p>
		

		<h4 id="q-3">3. What excites you about design?</h4>

		<p>Exploring new techniques and learning new abilities that further improve my design skills.</p>


		<h4 id="q-4">4. What are your strengths?</h4>

		<p>Pushing myself beyond my boundaries and taking kindly to feedback.</p>


		<h4 id="q-5">5. What are some areas of opportunity to work on?</h4>

		<p>Developing new styles and working with finer details, also not procrastinating.</p>


		<h4 id="q-6">6. What aspects of graphic design to you gravitate towards?</h4>

		<p>Logo designs and posters. playing around with type is really fun too to express different emotions and shit like that, package design ftw.</p>


		<h4 id="q-7">7. What are the roles and responsibilities of a graphic design in society?</h4>

		<p>The creators that draw in viewers through emotions using well crafted elements,
		colours, type, etc and help establish brands. they basically make the world a more interesting place by displaying messages in either literal or abstract ways that others could never think of
		.</p>


		<h4 id="q-8">8. When/where/why are you at your most creative/productive?</h4>

		<h4 id="q-9">9. What are your comfort levels with giving and receiving feedback? How might you improve your skills here? What strategies have worked for you??</h4>

		<p>Roast me to be honest. Criticism makes the world go around.</p>


		<h4 id="q-10">10. What is a website?</h4>

		<p>A platform where strangers can connect, share and display works that can entice the viewer. it can be a social platform, a store, or even a block of information that can be accessed world wide.</p>
